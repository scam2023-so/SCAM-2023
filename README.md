This respository contains the online appendix of "Improving Code Example Recommendations on Informal Documentation Using BERT and Query-Aware LSH: A Comparative Study".
For those interested in replicating this study, the data folder contains CSV files that incorporate the list of recommended code examples based on the query types: Natural Language-based and API Names-based. These results are based on the two implemented algorithms, namely Random Hyperplane-based (RH) LSH and Query Aware (QA) LSH. Inside the Result folder, there are the generated samples of code examples from the Query Aware approach.
In order to compare our work with baselines such as PostFinder and FaCoY, we have provided a set of recommended code examples for the 10 most popular Java libraries. These libraries include Jackson, SWT, MongoDB driver, Javax Servlet, JDBC API, JDT core, Apache Camel, Apache Wicket, Twitter4j, and Apache POI. We have also utilized the input queries from the PostFinder work, which are accessible from the following link:
